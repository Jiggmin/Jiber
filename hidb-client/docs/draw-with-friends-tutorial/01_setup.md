#### To install the hiDB Client we first need to open command prompt, and then after that we need two simple commands. After these two commands, the hiDB client should be installed and ready to be used when we need it! One command is needed to init and the other is needed to actually install the client, they are shown below:
### npm init
### npm install hidb-client
